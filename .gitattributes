# git help gitattributes
# text=auto
#   When text is set to "auto", the path is marked for automatic end-of-line normalization.
#   If Git decides that the content is text, its line endings are normalized to LF on checkin.
# eol=lf
#   This attribute sets a specific line-ending style to be used in the working directory.
# git help merge-file
# merge=union
#   Instead of leaving conflicts in the file, resolve conflicts favouring our (or their or both) side of the lines.

# Normalize to LF in the repository and working directory. Do not leave merge conflict markers in the files.
